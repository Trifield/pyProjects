# Fibonacci Sequence Project
If you don't know, a fibonacci sequence is adding the two previous numbers together. ( 11235813 etc. )\
Make a program that calculates the fibonacci sequence up to 10 numbers long.
## To use:
Use 2 variables only, and have a while loop doing the fibonacci sequence.
**Good Luck!**
